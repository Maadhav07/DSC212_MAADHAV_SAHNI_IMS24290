DSC212: Graph Theory - Modularity on the Karate Club GraphThis repository contains the complete implementation and analysis for the DSC212 research assignment on graph theory. The project implements the recursive spectral modularity partitioning algorithm from scratch to detect and analyze the community structure of Zachary's Karate Club network.The entire analysis is contained within the Jupyter Notebook: Karate_Club_Spectral_Modularity.ipynb.Assignment OverviewThe goal of this assignment is to build, execute, and analyze a community detection algorithm based on the principles of modularity maximization, as described by M. E. J. Newman. This involves translating the mathematical theory of spectral modularity into a functional Python implementation.Core TasksImplement Spectral Modularity Partitioning:Construct the $n \times n$ Modularity Matrix, $B = A - \frac{kk^T}{2m}$, using numpy for matrix operations.Implement a recursive bisection algorithm that uses the leading eigenvector ($u_1$) of the (restricted) modularity matrix to find the optimal split for a community.Apply the correct recursive stopping criterion: the algorithm stops partitioning a community $C$ when the leading eigenvalue of its restricted modularity matrix $B^{(C)}$ is non-positive ($\lambda_1^{(C)} \le 0$).Visualize the Partitioning Process:Visualize the graph at each step of the algorithm.A fixed spring_layout is used to ensure node positions remain constant, making the community splits (represented by changing colors) easy to observe.Compute and Analyze Node Metrics:After each split, compute the following four metrics for each node within its current subgraph:Degree CentralityBetweenness CentralityCloseness CentralityClustering CoefficientStore the results of this analysis at each iteration.Plot Metric Evolution:Use pandas and matplotlib/seaborn to create line plots showing how each node's metrics evolve from the initial global graph (Iteration 0) to their final community subgraph.Discussion and Analysis:Provide a written discussion analyzing the algorithm's results.Compare the final detected communities to the "ground truth" historical split of the club.Analyze the metric evolution plots to determine which nodes remain central and how community structure (i.e., the split) influences a node's role and its centrality scores.How to RunEnsure you have the required libraries installed (see Dependencies).Open the Karate_Club_Spectral_Modularity.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment (Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code).Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom. The notebook will:Load the graph and visualize the ground truth.Define all necessary functions.Execute the recursive algorithm, printing its progress.Display the sequence of visualization plots.Generate the metric evolution table and plots.Display the final discussion and comparison.DependenciesThe project relies on the standard scientific Python stack:networkx (for graph loading, manipulation, and metric computation)numpy (for all linear algebra and matrix operations)pandas (for storing and displaying metric evolution data)matplotlib & seaborn (for all visualizations)Summary of FindingsCommunity Detection: The algorithm successfully partitions the graph into two main communities, achieving 97% accuracy (33/34 nodes) against the "ground truth" historical split.Ambiguous Node: The single "misclassified" node (Node 9) is correctly identified as structurally ambiguous, validating a known insight from the network science literature.Metric Evolution: The analysis demonstrates the effect of community structure on node centrality.Hubs (Nodes 0 & 33): The faction leaders remain central in their respective subgraphs (high degree/closeness).Bridges (e.g., Nodes 8, 9, 31): These nodes show a dramatic drop in betweenness centrality after the split, quantifying their role as "global brokers" which is lost upon partitioning.Local Metrics (Clustering): These metrics remain largely stable, as they are independent of the global partition.
